            What Is Sustainable Living?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sustainable living is a lifestyle that aims to reduce one’s environmental impact,
             in ways that are sustainable both for the Earth and for the person.
              So while pledging to never run your faucet again may be sustainable for the planet,
               it probably wouldn’t be sustainable for you personally 
               (or for your friends who would be subject to your poor hygiene).
        </p>
        <p>
            There are endless ways to live sustainably, including: reducing your use of resources,
             composting, relying on clean energy sources, reducing your consumption of single-use plastic,
              eating less animal products, shopping for clothing and other items sustainably, buying local,
               and more.

        Sustainable Living Vs Zero Waste
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sustainable living and the zero-waste movement have similar goals and many similar lifestyle patterns,
        but are a little bit different.
        Those trying to live sustainably aim to lower their overall environmental impact in a variety of ways,
        while the primary focus of those living zero-waste is typically to reduce the amount of trash they produce,
        namely single-use plastic.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example,
        someone whose primary goal is to live zero-waste and produce zero trash may be comfortable 
        eating meat that was purchased without any plastic.
        But someone aiming to live a well-rounded, 
        sustainable lifestyle may consider the bigger picture 
        (aka the massive environmental impact and ethical concerns of animal agriculture) 
        and opt for a plant-based meal instead, even if it is packaged in plastic.

    </p>
    <h3>How to start Sustainable living?</h3>
    <p>here are numerous ways to start living more sustainably
        — and a sustainable lifestyle looks different for everyone.
        Areas where you can reduce your impact include:</p>

                    <p>
                    Animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs are the highest-impact foods on Earth.
                    To lower your diet’s footprint, consider transitioning to a vegan diet,
                    or at least eating more vegan meals.
                    Along with this, it’s important to focus on wasting less food.

                        Instead of sending food scraps (that includes things like vegetable peels,
                        avocado pits, and spoiled leftovers) to landfill, start composting.
                        Composting is the process of returning anything that comes from nature to the earth,
                        and letting it biodegrade into soil.
                        Setting up a compost bin is super easy if you have a backyard, 
                        but it’s also possible if you live in an apartment or in a city with no yard.

        Impact Of Sustainable Living

    </h2>
    <p>
        The average American produces 4.4 pounds of trash per day, according to the EPA — that comes out to more than 1,600 pounds per year. So by transitioning to a zero-waste lifestyle, you could literally save thousands of pounds of trash from going to landfills, where it would emit harmful greenhouse gases.
    </p>
    <p>
        By eating a vegan or plant-based diet, every year, you can save: 401,500 gallons of water, 14,600 pounds of grain; 10,950 square feet of forest, 7,300 pounds of CO2, and 365 animal lives, according to the Vegan Calculator.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it may seem like small changes such as going zero-waste or vegan won’t really make a difference, looking at those statistics make it clear that sustainability lifestyle changes can be powerful.

        What People Can Do?
    </h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>
            <h4>Grow Food</h4>
            <p>Growing some of your own food. Start a vegetable or herb garden, and plant a fruit tree or even two. This will save tonnes of transport greenhouse gases because the food will be right outside your door.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Preserve Food</h4>
            <p>Preserve Food
                Did you know that preserving food by pickling, drying or bottling is better than freezing in a refrigerator.
                Why? Because it uses less energy than the refrigerator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Reduce Waste</h4>
            <p>Reduce Waste
                Gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are released into the atmosphere from waste disposal sites. This adds to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Dangerous materials also leaking from rubbish dumps and pollute waterways and soil from rubbish dumps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Transportation</h4>
            <p>Use Public Transport
                Use public transport whenever you can to reduce the amount of gases from petrol powered cars. Ride your bike!</p>
